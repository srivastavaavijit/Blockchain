Centralised Network:
A centralized network is one where a single central authority or server controls and manages the entire system. 
In such a network, all communication, data processing, and decision-making are routed through this central entity.

Disadvantages in blockchain:
Vulnerability: If the central server or authority fails, the entire network can be disrupted or cease to function.
This vulnerability contrasts with blockchain's decentralized model, where the failure of one node doesn’t impact the entire network.

Data Loss: If data stored on a central server is lost or corrupted, it may not be recoverable unless there are adequate backup systems.

Transparency: Centralized systems may lack transparency, as users cannot easily verify or audit the central authority’s actions.

Trust in Data: In centralized networks, maintaining data integrity relies heavily on the central authority’s credibility and security measures.

Peer-To-Peer Network:
A P2P network is a decentralized network architecture where each participant (or "peer") has equal status and can act as both a client and a server. 
In a P2P network, resources and services are shared directly between peers without relying on a central server or authority.
Blockchain technology is built on a P2P network model. In a blockchain, each node (or participant) in the network maintains a copy of the entire blockchain ledger. 
Transactions are verified by consensus mechanisms, and the ledger is updated through a decentralized process without a central authority.

Advantages in Blockchain:
Distributed Control: Unlike centralized systems, where a single entity controls the entire network, P2P networks distribute control across all participants. 
In a blockchain, this means there is no central authority, reducing the risk of single points of failure and making the system more resilient to attacks or outages.

Resistance to Attacks: A P2P network is less susceptible to certain types of attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, because there is no central server to target. 
Instead, the attack would need to affect a significant portion of the network to be effective.

Open Ledger: Blockchain's P2P network allows for transparency, as all participants have access to the same ledger. 
This openness ensures that transactions can be independently verified and audited by anyone in the network, fostering trust among participants.

Redundancy: Since each node maintains a copy of the blockchain ledger, there is inherent redundancy in the system.
This means that data is replicated across multiple locations, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.
